explanation of each class type 

1. interface (Animal): 

An interface is a reference type in Java, like a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. This is an example of an interface where the method makeSound() must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.

2. Abstract Class (Mammal):

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, and it can contain abstract methods (methods that don't have a body) and concrete methods (methods that have a body).

In the Mammal class we have an abstract method walk() that must be implemented by subclasses and a concrete method eat() that provides a default implementation.

3. concrete class (dog and cat)

This is a class to which we can create an object and it provides implementation for all the abstract methods of parent classes or interfaces.
